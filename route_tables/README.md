###Route Tables

This component is responsible for configuring the routing between the VPCs.

The VPCs are peered.  The peering is non-transitive, meaning that the VPC does not have access to any other VPCs with which the peer VPC may be peered.  Also, to note the peered connection is bidirectional.
